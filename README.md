# SoilMoistureSensor
This project provides a soil moisture monitoring system using an Arduino board and a soil moisture sensor. The system reads moisture levels from the sensor and displays the readings, helping in efficient irrigation management.

## Features
  - Real-Time Monitoring: Continuously monitors soil moisture levels.
  - Display Readings: Shows moisture levels on a connected display.
  - Threshold Alerts: Triggers alerts when soil moisture levels fall below a set threshold.
    
## Components
  - ESP32
  - Soil Moisture Sensor
  - Display (Laptop)
  - Connecting Wires
  - Breadboard (optional)

## Installation
**1. Hardware Setup:**
 - Connect the soil moisture sensor to the ESP32.
 - Connect the display to the ESP32.
 - Use a breadboard if necessary for better organization.

**2. Software Setup:**
  - Install the Arduino IDE.
  - Download the project code from this repository.
  - Open the code in the Arduino IDE.
  - Upload the code to the ESP32.
    
## Usage
1. Insert the soil moisture sensor into the soil.
2. Power the Arduino board.
3. Monitor the display for real-time soil moisture readings.
